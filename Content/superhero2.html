    <p><span class="second-letter">H</span>is parents found out about this ability at the age 4 that he was able to jump into his own shadow at first. When his parents realized this the power of this ability they started to fear him try to seperate themselves from him for as long as possible. Then one day the military found out about this power so they took him and his parents did nothing to stop them from taking him. When he was taken he was experimented on from the age of 7 all the way until he was 16 years old. When the military tested him on his 16th birthday as they were taking him to the room he fought back by jumping into one of the gaurds shadows when the lights went out. Due to the fact that he was given military training and was going to be used as a weapon and he knew all of the secrets to his powers he was know free and could do what he wanted.</p>
