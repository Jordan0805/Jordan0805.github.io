    <p><span class="third-letter">A</span>s a young boy around the age of 6 his parents died and none of his relatives wanted to take him in so he got put into a orphanage. He was a very anti social person so he bought puppets and he played with his puppets all day long he only took a break when he had to eat or go to school or bed. One time when he was 13 years he acidentally brought his puppets to school when someone saw the puppets then he started to gets picked on. The same day the person who bullied him everyday stole one of his pupppets and broke it so he got so angry with all of his hatred for that person he stabed them. Then he felt this sensation of power flowing through his body so he focused it on the blood, then back to the bully and his hand move, and then he concentrated some more and his whole body moved he then realize that he made his bully into his own real life puppet. It was only as he grew older that the power he given need a large amount of blood from the victim to manipulated a person unlike an animal it also depended on the blood type.</p>
